## Web pages & graphical design
Websites with HTML/CSS/JS are not what I have spent the most time on throughout the years. Besides, the page that we are
on right now, I have once upon a time also created these sites:
- [Playmol](https://isaksengeir.github.io/playmol)
  - I created this site more or less from scratch (html/css). It served online **2012 - 2013**.
  - [View source @ github](https://github.com/isaksengeir/playmol/tree/master)
- [Brandsdalg Group](https://isaksengeir.github.io/brandsdal_group/)
  - This is a site I made for my Ph.D supervisor's research group in **2014** and maintained it up until around **2016**.
