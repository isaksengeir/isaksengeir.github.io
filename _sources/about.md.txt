<span style="font-family:Papyrus;"> It is true that I hold a *Ph.D* in computational chemistry / molecular sciences. It is
also true that when I began my university studies back in 2005 I knew little to nothing about the "*computational*" part. 
Nevertheless, when I first became familiar with molecular modeling and computer simulations, both my interests and my planned 
academic path started shifting. 
</span>

<span style="font-family:Papyrus;">
After a bachelor's degree in chemistry, I ended up doing my Master's degree in chemistry/structural biology (2008-2010)
as a 50/50 mix between experimental and theoretical work. Here I must admit that I have not set foot in a wet-lab ever since. 
During my Ph.D (2010-2015) I did only theoretical work and software development. Thus, my interests in coding, graphical 
design and software development awoke. After my Ph.D I did a post-doctoral,period partly in Uppsala, Sweden, followed by 
3 productive years as a senior researcher.

## Expertise & key skills
- Pioneering research and dissemination with publications in  world leading journals such as Nature Reviews,
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and Accounts of Chemical Research
- Recognized international partners, both theoretical and experimental, such as
Professor Johan Åqvist and Professor Maria Selmer through the 5-year project “Evolution of new genes and
proteins” with funding from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.
- More than 14 years of teaching experience as both course coordinator and lecturer. Has been responsible for own courses,
subject plans, laboratory experiments, examination and grading.
- Broad professional background ranging from experimental techniques such as X-ray crystallography and isothermal
titration calorimetry to theoretical methods such as empirical valence binding (EVB) and ab initio methods (QM).
- Software developer (Python, PyQt, Tkinter, fortran, bash, objective-C) with, among others, the graphical user interface
"Qgui", which has users all over the world. Qgui is also used regularly in teaching context at both Uppsala University 
and the University of Tromsø.

## Web pages & graphical design

Websites with HTML/CSS/JS have not been what I have spent the most time on throughout the years. But, besides the page that 
we are on right now, I have once upon a time also created and/or contributed to these sites:
### [Playmol](https://isaksengeir.github.io/playmol)
I created this site more or less from scratch (html/css). It served online **2012 - 2013**.
  - [View source @ github](https://github.com/isaksengeir/playmol/tree/master)

### [Brandsdal Group](https://isaksengeir.github.io/brandsdal_group/)
This is a site I made for my Ph.D supervisor's research group in **2014** and maintained it up until around **2016**.
    - [View source @ github](https://github.com/isaksengeir/brandsdal_group/tree/master)

### [CUBE3](https://site.uit.no/cube/)
All graphical design created by me - webpage created with [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/)

### [The Norwegian academic high-performance computing and storage services](https://documentation.sigma2.no/#the-norwegian-academic-high-performance-computing-and-storage-services)
Joint collaboration between UiT, UiO, UiB, NTNU and UNINETT Sigma2 where I have contributed particularly to the the 
software / application documentation of 
[Schrödinger](https://documentation.sigma2.no/software/application_guides/schrodinger/schrodinger.html?highlight=schrodinger#)
