Hello world!
-----------------------------
You have now entered my personal github cave - mostly created to  collect resources, cheats & hacks I tend to forget
|:notebook:|, but insignificantly also an attempt to keep track of what I have produced, contributed to, and/or created over the years.

These pages were created with the sole purpose of being my personal (yet so public) dumpster place, but you are of course
welcome to sniff around as much as you like, and if you like what you find, awesome! [*]_


*Happy computing*
